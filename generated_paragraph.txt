Dear Principal,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend school due to ill health. I am currently not feeling well and need to take a day's rest to recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will provide a medical certificate if required.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Dhruv Bishnoi
