Dear Principal,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend school for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, and after consulting with a doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to school.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Dhruv Bishnoi
