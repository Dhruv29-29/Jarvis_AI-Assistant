Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Respected Principal,

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend school for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, and after consulting with a doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to recover.

I regret any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I will make up for any missed work as soon as I am back to full health. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to school.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. I appreciate your help in ensuring that I can take the necessary time to recover and return to school as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Dhruv Bishnoi
